All tracks have been rerendered and renamed. Here is some useful information including exact track lengths and the proposed usage.

TitleScreen_, Title Screen -
	
	Intro -
		0:08:57 -- 0:8:57
		Introduces TitleScreen_Loop.
		The explosion was meant to compliment an animation at startup, so we can do any of these three things:

			1. keep the explosion and do the animation
			2. keep the explosion and not do the animation
			3. Simply remove the explosion
		
		All are fine by me.
